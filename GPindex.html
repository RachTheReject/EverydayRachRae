                <h1>KoKo Head Hike</h1>
                <p>1,048. That's how many stairs it takes to get to the top of this mountain. Making it to the top of this mountain was a momumental moment for me because of my sister. And before you ask, yes that is her looking back at me telling me to hurry up before it gets dark out! My sister loves to hike.</p>
                <p>This was my first time and she didn't take me up the stairs, she led me up the side of the mountain. I remeber asking her multiple times to call the helicopter for rescue because I wasn't going to make it. Of course she said no everytime, but that was all I needed. Even though I kept asking for rescue, I knew I was going to rescue myself by continuing to put one foot in front of the other.</p>

                <h1>Oxford House</h1>
                <p>Long story short, Oxford house saved my life. On 8/1/2017 I went from hopeless to hopeful. I struggled with addiction and had to clue how to stop using until I found Oxford House. OH taught and allowed me to be of service and a productive member to the community. This award keeps me grounded. It keeps me aware of where I have been and where I am going.</p>

                <h1>Graduation</h1>
                <p>Graduation Day. This was a day to remember. I was barely 18 and scared. I can admit that now. I thought I had it all figured out, but oh how underprepared for life I was! I can finally and confidently say that 18 year old me would be proud of who I am becoming.</p>

                <h1>Meet the family!</h1>
                <p>This is my why. Whenever I feel lost or like i'm not enough, I watch them and I can see exactly who I am. They keep me motivated and they keep me moving forward. </p>
